I am a cybersecurity graduate student pursuing entry-level Cybersecurity and SOC Analyst roles. CompTIA Security+ certified, with hands-on experience in security operations through SOC labs and simulated SOC environments. Focused on alert triage, log analysis, incident investigation, and SIEM-based monitoring. Comfortable documenting investigations, identifying false positives, and escalating potential threats based on evidence. Strong interest in blue team security, incident response, and cybercrime investigation. Motivated to contribute as a reliable, detail-oriented analyst while learning from experienced security teams in a collaborative environment

## Objective

My journey in IT has led me to develop a strong passion for cybersecurity, and I am now eager to transition into this field, specifically aiming to join a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst.
